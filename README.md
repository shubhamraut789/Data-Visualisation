Behavioral Research: Statistical Methods

                1 Statistical Deception
Sheet 1 (Statistical Deception) contains data for 4 groups, x1, x2, x3, x4.
The data has been specifically crafted so that it is misleading in one of
visualisation methods. Identify that method and plot it giving reasons as to
why it is so.
Now, plot the best visualisation for the given data. Justify your reasons
for the same.

                2 Personality and Motion
Sheet 2 (Movement Personality Results) contains the Joint Importance values
for personality traits like Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism.
Researchers analyzed the movement patterns of individuals and attempted
to predict personality scores. They employed machine learning models wherein
12 joint-movement vectors were used to predict personality scores.
The researchers now want to visualize the results to showcase how each
of these joints contributes to predicting each of the five personality scores.
Pick two ways to visualize this data and justify why one would be superior.
                3 Data Plotting Adventure
3.1 Subtask 1: The Last of Us
You’re part of a research team analyzing the survival outcomes of individuals
in different types of locations during a zombie apocalypse. The goal is to understand where survival chances are highest and what the common outcomes
are in each location.
• 118 people from the Safe Zone, who were males, turned into zombies.
• 62 people from the Safe Zone, who were males, survived.
• 4 people from the Safe Zone, who were females, turned into zombies.
• 141 people from the Safe Zone, who were females, survived.
• 154 people from the Contaminated City, who were males, turned into
zombies.
• 25 people from the Contaminated City, who were males, survived.
• 13 people from the Contaminated City, who were females, turned into
zombies.
• 93 people from the Contaminated City, who were females, survived.
• 422 people from the Rural Area, who were males, turned into zombies.
• 88 people from the Rural Area, who were males, survived.
• 106 people from the Rural Area, who were females, turned into zombies.
2
• 90 people from the Rural Area, who were females, survived.
• 670 people from the Isolated Island, who were males, turned into zombies.
• 192 people from the Isolated Island, who were males, survived.
• 3 people from the Isolated Island, who were females, turned into zombies.
• 20 people from the Isolated Island, who were females, survived.
3.2 Subtask 2: Glass Glimpse
Sheet 3 (Glass Glimpse) contains a part of the Glass Classification dataset.
Given this dataset, extract the rows pertaining to Glass Type and RI
(Refractive Index) and plot visualisations to understand the relationship between them. Mention what inferences you can make from your plot and
justify the reasoning behind your choice.
The types are numbered 1 to 7 as follows:
1. building-windows-float-processed
2. building-windows-non-float-processed
3. vehicle-windows-float-processed
4. vehicle-windows-non-float-processed (none in this database)
5. containers
6. tableware
7. headlamps
3.3 Subtask 3: Night at the Museum
Sheet 4 (Museum Visitor ) contains a part of the dataset which tracks visitors
at the Los Angeles Museums. We focus on five different museums and track
visitors from 2014 to 2023.
Given this dataset, plot visualisations to understand how the visitor count
changes over time. Mention what inferences you can make from your plot
and justify the reasoning behind your choice.

              4 Fast and Furious: Heatmap
Sheet 5 (Fast and Furious) contains data pertaining to automobiles enlisting
features such as a car’s brand, miles per gallon, manufactured year etc.
Plot a heatmap for different types of correlations between the features
present in the dataset and write about the inferences you can make from it.
Also justify as to why one is better than the other.
HINT: Make sure you convert all types to numeric and handle missing
values.
